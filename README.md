Learnings with Krish

execrise 1:
Write a NodeJS program to find a missing number of given sequence. sequence start number is random but it is guaranteed n+1 sequence. e.g.: if range is 10 numbers then array would contain 9 elements as one is missing
i.e. : numberSeq= [21,25,29,28,22,24,27,26,30] here missing one is 23. trick is if start number or end number is missing how to figure that. make sure they captured that.
